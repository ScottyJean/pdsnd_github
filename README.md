### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
To answer these questions using Python, I had to write a Python script. A template with helper code and comments was provided in a bikeshare.py file. I used the three city dataset files:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
